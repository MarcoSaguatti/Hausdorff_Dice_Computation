# Hausdorff_Dice_Computation
This program calculates 95 percentile Hausdorff distance (HD), volumetric Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and surface Dice similarity coefficient (SDSC) between manually contoured and automatically contoured pelvic structures.
Particularly, it computes these metrics for five organs at risk (i.e. prostate, rectum, bladder, left femur and right femur) contoured in three different ways: manually, using a deep learning segmentation algorithm and using a model based segmentation algorithm.
The final output is stored in a .xlsx file.
